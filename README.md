# GPS_Tracking_App
Android, services, broadcast receivers

This is a university Android project based on GPS Services.

The "AndroidHuaProject" folder contains an interface with the database, alongside with a content provider.

The "GPS_Track" folder implements a process where you enter an ID and an Android Service writes to the database the latitude
and longitude of the user when his/her location is changed.

Finally, the "Google_Map_Impl" folder basically displays the coordinates of all the locations that the user has been to.
